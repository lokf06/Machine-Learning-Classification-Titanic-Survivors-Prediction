# Machine-Learning-Classification-Titanic-Survivors-Prediction
In this Python coding excerise, using titanic dataset from Kaggle.com to predict survivors and in particular to predict which type of passengers were likely to be survived. 
Machine Leaning techniques used: EDA, model selection, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV), model evaluation and score(confusion matrix, classification repport, ROC curve, AUC score).
